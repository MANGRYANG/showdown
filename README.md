It aims to bring together the strategic depth of Chess and the unique gameplay elements of Janggi into a single, engaging experience.<br>


<b>Development of an ASCII-based game engine using C++</b>

The game engine for this project is being developed entirely in C++ to ensure optimal performance and full control over game mechanics.<br>
The CLI-based approach allows for a lightweight and accessible gameplay experience without relying on external graphical libraries.<br>
